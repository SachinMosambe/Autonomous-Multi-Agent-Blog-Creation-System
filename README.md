# BlogWriter Crew: AI-Powered Blog Generator

Welcome to **BlogWriter Crew**, an AI-powered blog generation tool! With a team of AI agents, **BlogWriter Crew** helps you create professional-quality blog posts on any topic you choose. Using **crewAI** and a set of specialized agents, the system can research, write, edit, and review your content, giving you a polished blog post in minutes.

## Features

* **Collaborative AI Agents**: Four AI agents working together to create high-quality blog posts.

  * **Planner**: Researches the topic and creates an outline.
  * **Writer**: Drafts the complete blog post based on the plan.
  * **Editor**: Reviews and improves the content.
  * **Reviewer**: Performs a final quality check.

* **Gradio Interface**: User-friendly interface to interact with the AI agents and generate blog posts easily.

* **Markdown Output**: Blog posts are generated in Markdown format for easy integration into your website or platform.

## Installation

### Requirements

* Python 3.10 to 3.13
* **UV** (dependency manager for seamless setup)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:

   * First, install **UV** to manage the project’s dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies**:

   After installing **UV**, navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   crewai install
   ```

   This command will install all the required dependencies for the project.

3. **Set up environment**:

   Ensure you add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the `.env` file for API access.

### Customizing Your Setup

You can easily modify the project to suit your needs:

* Modify the agents and tasks in `src/blog_writer/config/agents.yaml` and `src/blog_writer/config/tasks.yaml`.
* Update the logic in `src/blog_writer/crew.py` to suit your requirements.
* Customize the `src/blog_writer/main.py` for custom inputs or additional logic.
* Make your app interactive by editing `app.py`.

## Running the Project

To start the system and generate blog posts, run:

```bash
crewai run
```

This will initialize the **BlogWriter Crew**, which will collaborate to generate a blog post. The result will be stored in a `report.md` file.

### Interactive UI with Gradio

If you'd prefer an interactive way to generate blog posts, the project comes with a **Gradio** interface:

1. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open the provided URL (usually something like `http://localhost:7860/`) to interact with the Gradio app.

3. Enter a topic, click "Generate Blog Post," and the system will generate a professional blog post based on the topic.

## How It Works

The **BlogWriter Crew** uses a team of AI agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of blog writing:

1. **Planner**: Researches the topic and outlines the structure.
2. **Writer**: Writes the blog post based on the plan.
3. **Editor**: Reviews and refines the content.
4. **Reviewer**: Performs a final check to ensure the blog post is ready.

The entire process can take a few minutes depending on the complexity of the topic.
